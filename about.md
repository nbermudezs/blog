Wow! It is so difficult to write about yourself! This single sentence is the result of many many attempts to write something witty and/or clever but at some point I just gave up and decided to write this instead. So here it goesâ€¦

Iâ€™m this guy:

Handsome, right!? I thought so ðŸ˜‰.

I was named NÃ©stor BermÃºdez, after my father, grandpa and great-grandpa, how cool is that!? And to answer your question, yes, my sonâ€™s name is going to be NÃ©stor BermÃºdez as well, duh.

I was born in Honduras; oldest of 3 children of two loving, hardworking parents. I love coffee, nature and reading a book in a cold day. Iâ€™m terrible at dancing, a little bit less terrible at cooking, a not so terrible photographer and a decent software developer.

Recently I applied for graduate college and I had to write a bunch of statements of purpose and essays. It took months! But, damn, you learn so much about yourself. One of the things I realized is that Iâ€™m not a software developer or a mathematician but rather a problem solver which turns out to have worked in math and computer science. I love puzzles and challenges regardless of the domain.

So yes, I applied to a couple universities and I finally started my masterâ€™s in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Fall 2017. Pretty fun so far.

There you go, now you know a little bit about me.
