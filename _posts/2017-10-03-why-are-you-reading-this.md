Seriously, why are you reading this?

Chances are, you are one of the two people that recommended I should start a blog. But who knows, maybe a third person will eventually read it.

Let me set the expectations straight‚Ä¶
This isn‚Äôt a technical blog but I may write something about Computer Science and/or Math from time to time.

This isn‚Äôt a photography blog but you will probably see a picture (taken by me) on each of my blog posts and I may write about my photos and a trick or two I learn.

This isn‚Äôt a travel blog but I will share with you some of my travel experiences and more photos! Yay! You will learn that I love taking pictures but not so much appearing in them üôÇ

This isn‚Äôt a student blog but, since I‚Äôm currently enrolled back in college, you will probably read a lot about my college experiences. Yes, that will probably include the occasional whining, fun/new experiences, thoughts about homework and projects and such, etc.

So ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this blog about then?‚Äù you may ask. Well, it is just a place for me to take thoughts out my head but I guess most personal blogs are like this, nothing new on that. I‚Äôll write about things that I find interesting, things that pissed me off, things that drew a smile on my face.

I‚Äôm planning to write at least once a week but lets see how it goes.

You, reader, if you are one of the two people that told me to start a blog, thanks! It took a while but better late than never, right?
I do hope you (and the other readers, if any) enjoy my writings.

Ah! I almost forget about the photo‚Ä¶ I took the picture on this post in Antofagasta, Chile two years ago while leading the Honduras delegation for the Ibero-american Math Olympiad. Lovely place, sea on one side, desert on the other.
