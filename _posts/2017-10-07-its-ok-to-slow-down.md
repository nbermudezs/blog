I‚Äôm currently a member of this program called GLOBE (Global Leaders Orange Blue Engagement) at UIUC. It is such an awesome program. I‚Äôve had to pleasure to meet so many wonderful people and meet with some of them on a regular-ish basis; Madina, Meera, Lamya and Sushma, thanks for taking the time to get together and share.

Madina is a math student from Kazakhstan and also one of the persons that recommended I should start a blog. Meera is from Arizona and studies psychology, Lamya is from Irak and studies translation, and Sushma is from India and studies urban planning.

Today, we decided to go have dinner together at this place called Salad something, nice salad bar, quiet place. So we had salads and talked for a while. Madina brought Kazakhs‚Äô chocolate! Thanks!

You know, October is the month of Halloween and, although it is still far away, we at UIUC don‚Äôt really like to wait so there will be themed events probably throughout the entire month. There was one today anyways, Spooked Illinites: haunted house, palm reading, karaoke, bingo. So we decided to head there after finishing our salads, I wasn‚Äôt super excited to go but went anyways üôÇ

We were early so we roamed the place for a while. By the time we wanted to enter the Haunted house there was this huuugee line so Madina and I decided to bail out with the intention to go home. But then on our way out we started talking about books, about life in Kazakhstan and we ended up talking for a long while. And then Claudia showed up, she‚Äôs a Chemical Eng. PhD student from Colombia (and also a GLOBE member) I met right before classes started. So we kept talking for another while and then two more people appeared! Amod and Mariam, from India and Georgia (the country, not the state :P) respectively. They both study computer science (like me).
As you would guess we kept talking for a while about random stuff. The more the merrier, right!? So nice to see y‚Äôall tonight and have a chance to catch up. Mariam ‚Äì I hope you did get to have your palm read üôÇ

We all are grad students and it has been a bit of shock, at least for me, how different grad school is compared to undergrad. Even just a small number of classes (I taking just 3) can take up pretty much all your time between assignments, research projects, lectures, additional reading, practice. How the teaching and collaboration works (I‚Äôll probably write an entire post about this soon, it‚Äôs been a real shock). With all those things to deal with it feels kind of negligent to just stop, have a look around you, enjoy the weather, talk with someone, workout or do anything that does not contribute to your coursework.

I‚Äôve been focusing on studying (like‚Ä¶ a lot) and assignments this whole week, apparently a little bit too much as 3 people told me today: ‚Äúyou look really tired‚Äù. If that‚Äôs not a wake up call, I don‚Äôt know what it is. So here I‚Äôm writing this blog post instead of going to bed just because I want, it doesn‚Äôt contribute at all to all those assignments and reading I need to do but it‚Äôs OK. Tomorrow is a new day.

I had such a good time with y‚Äôall tonight. It was nice to get away from the laptops and books and just talk for a while. ‚ÄòTil next time! In the meantime I‚Äôll get back to work, not before having a good night of sleep.

Have a great weekend!

About the photo‚Ä¶ I took that picture in a train in Switzerland. I almost couldn‚Äôt believe the view I had.
I was on my way to the Swiss Alps and didn‚Äôt change trains when I had to so I ended up going somewhere else, met some nice people in the train which made the trip more memorable. I wouldn‚Äôt have taken that picture or met the people I met if I had taken the right train. Things always work out, just don‚Äôt panic!
