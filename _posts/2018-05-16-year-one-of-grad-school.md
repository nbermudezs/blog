title:  "Year one of grad school"

As you may know, I started my Masters in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign last August.
Now that summer has started I've officially completed my first year of grad school -- although I'm still waiting for my grades.

I'll be interning at a startup called Firefly this summer until I still have a few weeks left before I start. So, understandably, I've come to realize that I have lots of free time. And what better thing to do with free time than to write, right? This time let me tell you about my thoughts on this first year of grad school.

Let's start with the campus itself... as Donald Trump would put it: it is HUUUUGE. Lots of libraries, teaching facilities and labs all over the place and a massive recreational center with pools, running tracks, saunas, a climbing wall and the usual gym stuff. Two of the ECE/CS buildings shown in the picture below.

Second, the students... They are for sure the smartest people I've come to meet. In CS there is this stereotype of kept-for-themselves, shy, introvert people. That is just not true here. People try to socialize, go to bars, talk in the lobby; at least when we are not busy working on research or assignments. Most people are friendly and willing to partake in conversations, again, when they are not too busy with work. Another thing I noticed is that the libraries are busy every day and there is always students putting all-nighters since the beginning of the semester. This is just a result of both a challenging university and determined and driven students.

Which brings me to the coursework itself. Oh man, it gets busy. UIUC is a research powerhouse, which means very high level lectures, little handholding and yet challenging homework and projects, which is awesome! That also means lots of students ranting, which is always fun to read.
I've taken 5 classes, all of them in the CS department, and I've learned a lot; the TAs are always helpful and you get to chose your research projects! Is it perfect? Hell no, I recently took CS446 (Machine Learning), which UIUC has been trying to revamp for a few semesters now. This usually means experimenting to see what it works and what not, which is great for the people that will enjoy the class in a few semesters when it stabilizes but not so much for us, guinea pigs. I've overall liked the class, both lecturers are great and the content is definitely relevant. Anyways, I went sideways... TLDR: coursework is demanding but worth your while (and bucks).

I'll wrap up by taking about research and my experience with it so far...
I'm currently working with [Prof. Sheldon H. Jacobson](http://shj.cs.illinois.edu/) on stochastic optimization.
We are exploring ways to reduce the number of replications of an experiment while maximizing a second metric, e.g. score function. Unlike most statistical analysis we care about extremes instead of means. It has certainly be interesting to work on a problem not many people are working on and with approaches that, most likely,
no one is working on.
During the first weeks I had a problem with "showing" results because I'd spend an adecuate amount of time in the software engineering side of research (writing nice code that others can read, DRY code, tested code). Eventually I had to adapt and started paying less attention to it, which really really bothers me and is the reason I started writing this post in the first place. At first I thought it was just me but then I was reading Ian Goodfellow's paper on GANs and found his original code on GitHub.

I'm taking the next sentence verbatim from such repo:
> We are an academic lab, not a software company, and have no personnel devoted to documenting and maintaing this research code. Therefore this code is offered with absolutely no support.


At first I couldn't understand why being "an academic lab" was an excuse for not documenting nor maintaining code. But I now understand that, sometimes, in order to meet your advisor's expectations you have to make compromises on your code. But more importantly, the nature of research itself is such that many of the things you try wont work or wont lead to the "right" answer (or to an answer at all), so I now understand the reasoning of "why would I spend too much time on a code I'll probably throw away in a few weeks?" (paraphrasing one of my TAs that does ML research here).

After talking with other fellow grad students I realized that I was not alone in this feeling of "I'm writing shitty code" when doing research work and although we don't feel good about we now see it as a necessary evil. We do our best to avoid it but it's fine to let one slip occasionally. One of the colleagues I was discussing this with is a PhD student in the formal methods group and the story seems completely different there. FM/SE groups are probably one of the few places where code quality and best practices DO matter when doing research. Maybe I'll end up joining their group. Or maybe not, who knows. Right now I'm enjoying what I do so that's all it matters.


A few other lessons I've learned while doing research:

1) keep a journal! This serves for both keep yourself accountable and to have something to come back to when you start writing a paper and can't remember that setup you ran for experiment number #11235. Trust me, you won't remember from the top of your head.

2) get your data visualization skills on point. It is always easy to show results with a nice plot than hand waving in the air.

3) talk with others and try to explain what your research is about. I only started to truly understand what I was doing when I tried to explain it to others. This really goes for everything in life. "Do I understand this well enough to explain it to others?". On top of that, they may have some interesting ideas about it. Outsider's eyes are always good.

4) there are, sometimes, layers of boring work that has to be done before you get to some interesting work and results. You just have to bare with it and keep in mind the target. Advisors are great this; a good advisor will keep the eyes on the target even the way to it is foggy or pitch black.


Anyways, although I miss working in industry, I've enjoyed this first year and I look forward to my second one. I've learned a lot, met great people and, hopefully, created connections with some of them for life.

Until next time...
