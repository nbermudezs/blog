Today, I couldn’t be more proud of being a Honduran.

Yesterday millions of fellow citizens had their pinky fingers tainted. A sign that they have exercised their right to vote. For decades the elected representatives have been of one of the two major parties in the country: Liberal Party and Nacional Party. Today, the leading candidate belongs to a different party.

A party that offers a fresh view to a country governed by a dictator and swamped in corruption and poverty problems; a country that is often regarded as one of the most violent countries in the world; a place were fundamental rights are violated without consequences.

So, “why are you proud?” you may wonder… For years the two main parties have alternate the seat at the presidency, in part because many rural areas of the country are traditionalists that vote based on the color of the party without looking at the candidate in question; in part because many people did not go to vote and, finally, because there are always rumors of violations to our democracy: buying votes, buying spots at the voting staff that check the validity of the votes and many more dirty techniques to control the outcome of the election. I was so happy to see live broadcasts of the process, people in Facebook denouncing  even the smallest inconsistencies they could find, staying awake until 2am until they finally heard official word that Salvador Nasralla was ahead in the counting.

This time was different, the turnover has been unprecedented, the people are tired of being ruled by a despot, they have let themselves be heard, squads of citizens have taken the task of overseeing the counting process, record any inconsistency and report it. Yes, it is unfortunate that we have to do this in the first place but I’m glad the people finally understood it was necessary if we wanted a real change to happen. Of all the elections, this one was the one to take action. There is too much at stake…

The candidate running in second place (National Party) is our current president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, a man that have made everything in his power to stay there. A man that is running for re-election in the first place because **his** Supreme Court ruled in favor even when the constitution explicitly prohibits consecutive terms re-election. Move that some years ago resulted in the president at the time, Manuel Zelaya Rosales, to be forcefully taken out of the country and out of the presidency. Hypocritical, isn’t it? No wonder Hernandez’ campaign slogan was “I’ll do what I have to do”. Yes, violent crimes have decreased in the country and I’m happy for that but what about employment, education, poverty, taxes and freedom of speech problems?

Now, the TSE, entity in charge of tabulating votes and naming the winner, had released preliminary results that put Salvador Nasralla at the head but votes are still coming and they expect to have a final count by Thursday. So far the lead is of about 5% and about 70% of the votes have been processed. The people, myself included, believe the results are clear enough now; the candidate for the Liberal Party have already acknowledged Nasralla as the winner and urges the TSE to do the same.

I hope this will be the beginning on a transformation of a country that have had to deal with despot governments for decades; that our new president will be wise enough to surround himself with capable people, people that care about the country and not just about making money. It won’t be easy, I’m sure there will be resistance and hiccups but I think the key will be transparency; if something goes wrong we want to know and we want to be able to have a saying.

To a new beginning, a new hope for Honduras. Thanks to all my fellow citizens that made it possible.
